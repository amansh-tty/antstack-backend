In this Backend assignment I created an API which converts HEX color codes into RGB Color codes.
The libraries that I used are dotenv, ExpressJs.
I used neon database.
The working on the API can be seen in postman when you put in the URL
- "http://127.0.0.1:5000/convert/hexrgb/"
and enter in the key and value and pull a GET Request you'll get the output as object of RGB values and if it's cached i.e, already requested color codes that is being extracted from the database.
